# CSCI4622-Project-Music-Genre-Classification

This is the final project for CSCI 4622 Machine Learning at CU Boulder. Using the GTZAN dataset from Kaggle, we are using the features data to classify songs by genre with KNN and the spectrogram data to classify with convolutional neural nets. We also created overlayed spectrograms with added background noise to test the limits of the CNN classifier.
